# Base64 Image Encoder

This Python script allows users to select an image file, encode it in Base64, and save the encoded content to a text file. The script uses Tkinter for file selection dialogs and stores configuration settings in an INI file.

## Features

- Allows users to select an image file through a graphical file dialog.
- Encodes the selected image in Base64 format.
- Saves the encoded content to a text file.
- Remembers the output directory for future runs using a configuration file.
- Displays a macOS notification upon successful encoding (if enabled).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations on macOS)
- macOS (for the notification feature)

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Select an image file when prompted.
3. If running for the first time, select an output directory for saving the encoded text file.
4. The script will encode the image and save the Base64 content to a text file in the selected directory.
5. A macOS notification will be displayed upon successful encoding (if enabled).

### Example

Run the script and follow the prompts to select an image file and output directory.
